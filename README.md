# Kado Flower

Static flower-themed page with no backend. This is ready for free hosting.

## Fastest free publish (GitHub Pages)

This repo already includes `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`.

1. Push this project to **your own GitHub repo**.
2. In GitHub: `Settings` -> `Pages` -> `Build and deployment`.
3. Set `Source` to **GitHub Actions**.
4. Push to `main` (or run the workflow manually from `Actions`).
5. Your site URL will be shown in the deploy job output.

## Local structure

- Entry page: `index.html`
- Animation page: `flower.html`
- Styles: `css/style.css`, `css/main.css`

## Notes

- Keep this as a static site (HTML/CSS/JS only) for simplest free hosting.
- All current paths are relative, so they work on GitHub Pages.
